# pipfy.video & pipfy.captions

a web app to create a floating webcam image or floating subtitles on your desktop: picture-in-picture for your webcam and speech-to-text in a browser window. hence the name.

## usage

best for desktop use. click on start video, then allow your browser to access your webcam of choice. click on hover (or right click -> pip) to trigger the floating picture-in-picture window. crop to taste. you can flip the image if you prefer to watch yourself in mirrored view.

same for audio. except that captioning only works in google chrome because it uses the google speech-to-text API. use at your discretion. it is the only free (meaning affordable) API that at least approximates usable accuracy.


## development

both features are full of dirty workarounds and unfinished remnants of code from debugging or dead ends of copied code from other projects. they are also woefully unfinished as accessibility tools. the irony is not lost on us. at least they are shipped.

we are happy to help you make sense of things if you want to help clean up and improve.


## license

as of the initial commit we release the code into the public domain via the wtf-agreement. do what you want, at your own risk.

we may publish subsequent commits under a more narrow license to streamline development and make the code base compatible with other licenses.
